- 👋 Hi! I’m Vincent Rigolot or @Noh4ns3n 
- 👀 I’m interested in chemical biology and data exploitation, mainly from fluorescence microscopy (confocal, FLIM, XRF) and chemistry related techniques (NMR, MS, IR spectra)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python to add it to my data-manipulation arsenal 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything ! but ideally projects at the interface with chemical biology
- 📫 Reach me via mail : rigolot.vincent@gmail.com
